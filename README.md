#Build the navigation menu. This will dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page. This can be a particularly useful trick when you begin working with content management systems or APIs when you are uncertain of where the items will be.
#Add functionality to distinguish the section in view. While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections.
#Add the functionality to scroll to sections. Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page.
#Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
#Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
